# Cpp_Dynamic_Arrays
## Tasks
1. Insert row in double dimension dynamic array in given position
2. Insert column in double dimension dynamic array in given position
3. Delete given row from double dimension dynamic array
4. Delete given column from double dimension dynamic array
5. Initialize and load two double dimension dynamic arrays randomly in `-10` and `15` range. Print.
   User defines number of rows and columns. Get product of arrays.
   Matrixes can be multiplied if `〖(A〗_(n*m)*B_(m*l)=C_(n*l)`.
6. Get sum and product of two polynomials whose coefficients defined by dynamic arrays
7. Given `A[M]` and `B[N]`. Create third array with minimal size which gathers elements of both arrays.
8. Given `A[M]` and `B[N]`. Create third array with minimal size which gathers same elements of both arrays.
9. Given `A[M]` and `B[N]`. Create third array with minimal size which includes `A` elements which aren't in `B`.
